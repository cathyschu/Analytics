What I’ve enjoyed most about these diverse experiences is meeting incredible people, making lasting friendships, and constantly being inspired by new perspectives. This inspiration sparked my official journey into Analytics, a field I’m deeply passionate about. I’m always excited to explore both the possible and the impossible in this ever-evolving discipline.\n\n\nSingapore Management University | Masters of IT in Business | Expected Dec 2025\n\n\n\nMultiple MNCs | Program Manager, Training instructor | Singapore"
